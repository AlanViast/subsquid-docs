# Quickstart: Substrate chains

The `substrate` squid template indexes transfers on the Kusama network. It is intended to be a stepping stone for building a custom squid for any Substrate-based chain. 

## Pre-requisites

Before getting to work on your very first squid, verify that you have installed the following software: 

- Node v16.x or newer
- [Squid CLI](/squid-cli/installation)

Please note:
- The squid template is **not** compatible with `yarn`. Use `npm` instead.

## Step 1: Scaffold from a template

Come up with a new memorable name for your squid. Choose the template matching your network and 
scaffold using [`sqd init`](/squid-cli/init).

- For indexing native events emitted by Substrate-based chains, use `substrate` 
- For indexing Frontier EVM contracts on Astar and Shiden use `frontier-evm`
- For indexing ink! smart contracts, use `ink`

For example:

```bash
sqd init my-awesome-squid --template substrate
cd my-awesome-squid
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

## Step 3: Launch Postgres in a detached Docker container

```bash
sqd up
```

## Step 4: Create the database schema and run the processor

The squid we have just built ingests pre-indexed data from a Kusama Archive. This data is then transformed, as defined by the data handler supplied to the `processor.run()` call in `src/main.ts`.
 
This command will keep the console busy until manually terminated:

```bash
sqd process
```

## Step 5: Start the GraphQL server

Run in a separate terminal window:

```bash
sqd serve
```

The GraphQL playground is available at [`http://localhost:4350/graphql`](http://localhost:4350/graphql). Open it in a browser and run
sample queries by applying filters and data selections in the panel to the left.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  accountsConnection(orderBy: id_ASC) {
    totalCount
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Customize

[Hack](/store/postgres/schema-file) the schema file `schema.graphql` and the [processor](/basics/squid-processor) to index the data your way. Pick an Archive for your network at the [Supported networks](/substrate-indexing/supported-networks) page.
