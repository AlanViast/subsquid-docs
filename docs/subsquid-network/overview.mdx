# Overview

Subsquid Network is a distributed query engine and data lake that the Subsquid ecosystem is built around.

Currently it serves historical blockchain data for 80+ networks. Compared to data access using a conventional chain node RPC, Subsquid Network allows one to access data at near zero cost, in a more granular fashion and from multiple blocks at once, thanks to its rich batching and filtering capabilities.

It comes in two flavors:

1. A decentralized permissionless network **(testnet)**

2. An open private network ran by Subsquid **(production-ready)**
   * [Supported EVM networks](/subsquid-network/reference/evm-networks)
   * [Supported Substrate networks](/subsquid-network/reference/substrate-networks)

Both variants are freely accessible to public using the same [API](/subsquid-network/reference).

If you are a network developer and would like to see your chain supported by Subsquid, please fill a [form](https://forms.gle/ioVNFiPjZgvUNunY9) or contact us in [SquidDevs Telegram chat](https://t.me/HydraDevs).

## Permissionless public network

The decentralized version of Subsquid Network is currently a testnet. It serves data for a (growing) subset of networks supported by the [private cluster](#open-private-network). Each request is routed to the network node responsible for the appropriate subset of data via a local p2p gateway.

You can read more about the testnet [here](/subsquid-network/public).

## Open private network

Subsquid's private data lake (formerly known as Archives) is a production-ready fork of early Subsquid Network that runs on Subsquid infrastructure. It provides a stand-in for the permissionless Subsquid Network until it matures; its [API](/subsquid-network/reference) is identical to that of p2p gateways of the public network.

The gateway of this private network is public and free to query. URLs for datasets of supported networks are available via [`@subsquid/archive-registry`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/archive-registry):

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="evm" label="EVM">
```

List all supported networks:
```bash
npx --yes -p @subsquid/archive-registry squid-archive-registry -t evm
```
Usage in [squids](/sdk) within [`EvmBatchProcessor` configuration](/sdk/reference/processors/evm-batch/general/#set-data-source):

```ts
import { lookupArchive } from '@subsquid/archive-registry'

const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
     // resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet'
     archive: lookupArchive('eth-mainnet')
   })
```

See the [EVM datasets](/subsquid-network/reference/evm-networks/) page for exact lookup calls for all supported networks.

```
Usage in [squids](/sdk) within [`SubstrateBatchProcessor` configuration](/sdk/reference/processors/subtrate-batch/general/#set-data-source):

```ts
import { lookupArchive } from '@subsquid/archive-registry'

const processor = new SubstrateBatchProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
     // resolved to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/phala'
     archive: lookupArchive('phala', {release: 'ArrowSquid'}),
     chain: 'https://api.phala.network/rpc'
   })
```
