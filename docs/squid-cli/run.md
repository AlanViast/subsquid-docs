`sqd run`
=========

Run a squid locally according to the [deployment manifest](/cloud/reference/manifest).

* [sqd run PATH](#sqd-run-path)

Notes:
 - The command is especially useful for running [multichain squids](/sdk/resources/multichain), as it runs all services in the same terminal and handles failures gracefully.
 - Environment variables are read from the deployment manifest; `.env` file is ignored. 
 - Unlike the common `commands.json` script `sqd process`, `sqd run` will neither build nor apply migrations automatically.
   ```bash
   sqd build
   sqd migration:apply
   sqd run .
   ```
   is a common sequence of commands when using `sqd run` in local development.
